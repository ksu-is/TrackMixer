"'Explanation for the install section! If you used the test feature then you do not have to reinstall Pydub or Pyaudio. If you have not seen the test feature
then your machine will need time to install everything into Anaconda. Random is used to shuffle between tracklists and AudioSegment is used to actually get audio from the tracks.
Explanation for the song1-6! This is where you put either all of your vocal or backing tracks, try to keep them seperated from each other.
Same goes for song7-12, put the opposite accompament for what you did in song1-6. If you wish to add more tracks follow the given song and add the title to list 1 or 2."'

"'Bonus assistance! How to replace this with a path to a .wav file, assuming the .wav file is on your machine somewhere. First, find the file on your computer.
If you can't find it then search the entire computer for any .wav . Once located, right click the file and click Copy as path. Then replace the hashtagged info with
your new path to a .wav file. You will need to double backslash everything, if your file is C:\users\you\music\vocal\song.wav then it will need to become
C:\\users\\you\\music\\vocal\\song.wav. This can rarely need to be done with forward slashes, if problems keep occuring, this could be why."'
