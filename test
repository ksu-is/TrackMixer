# Use this to test or install Pydub
# Pydub only plays .wav files without additional extentions
# pip install pydub
# Remove the '#' infront of pip to install Pydub, you only need to do this once
# conda install -c anaconda pyaudio
# Remove the '#' infront of conda to install Pyaudio, same as Pydub but this installation code works best in Anaconda
import pydub
from pydub import AudioSegment
from pydub.playback import play
#Enter the path of the file you wish to play
wav_file = AudioSegment.from_file(file = )
play(wav_file)
# The easiest way to get the path is to Copy Path directly from your files
