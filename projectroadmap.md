Figured out what a project road map is. Thank you to everyone on teams.
I guess if I had to make a list of steps for this it would go like:
- [x] 1. Get Pydub working
- [x] 2. Figure out which songs to use for each section
- [x] 3. Download each track, either a karaoke version or regularlly
- [x] 4. Use Spleeter to isolate vocals (or instrumentals if needed)
- [x] 5. Convert all the tracks into .wav instead of .mp3
- [x] 6. Program Pydub to play two tracks at once
- [?] 7. Make each track stop together (when the shortest one ends)
- [x] 8. Get the randomization element working?
- [ ] 9. Hoping this looks coherent to anyone who has never used Pydub before
