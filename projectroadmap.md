Figured out what a project road map is. Thank you to everyone on teams.
I guess if I had to make a list of steps for this it would go like:
from tikinter import *
root = Tk()
c = Checkbutton(root, text = "1. Get Pydub working") c.pack()
1. Get Pydub working
2. Figure out which songs to use for each section
3. Download each track, either a karaoke version or regularlly
4. Use Spleeter to isolate vocals (or instrumentals if needed)
5. Convert all the tracks into .wav instead of .mp3
6. Program Pydub to play two tracks at once
7. Make each track stop together (when the shortest one ends)
8. Get the randomization element working?
9. Hoping this looks coherent to anyone who has never used Pydub before
